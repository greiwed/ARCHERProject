# ARCHERProject

This project analyzes four micrphone inputs and analyzes them to determine if a clap was detected. If so, it calculates where the clap originated and displays that information on an LCD screen. The majority of the initilization code was generated with help by STM32CubeMX software. I wrote and modified some additional .c and .h files.
